Hi, my name is Trevor Jordan and this is my online CV. Currently, I am a Senior Data Analyst for Capital One Bank. Previously I was a Data Analyst for Compare.com, and before that I was attending the University of Virginia for my Bachellor's in Economics.

Each projects has its own page with a brief description and a link to the GitHub repository. If you'd like to contact me, feel free to reach out via LinkedIn.
